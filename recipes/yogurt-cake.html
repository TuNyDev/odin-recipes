    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A lemon pound cake made with yogurt instead of sour cream. I have used
      this recipe for a long time and had misplaced it. I went to my daughter
      and had her give me another copy.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 eggs, room temperature 1</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container lemon flavored yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a
        10-inch bundt pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture;
        add lemon extract with last egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Alternately mix in the
        flour mixture and the yogurt, starting and ending with the dry
        ingredients. Beat just until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60
        minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes
        out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a
        wire rack and cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
